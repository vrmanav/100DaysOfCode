# 100 Days Of Code

Welcome to my personal repository where I will be documenting my journey of learning Python language and developing 100 different projects over the course of 100 days mentored by Angela Yu on Udemy. Each day, I will be writing original code with zero percent plagiarism to reinforce my learning and improve my skills.

## Motivation

I started this challenge as a way to commit myself to learning Python and improving my coding skills. By working on different projects every day, I hope to expand my knowledge and become a more proficient developer.

## Goals

My primary goal is to complete 100 days of code with original projects and code. I also aim to learn and understand Python's core concepts such as data structures, loops, functions, modules, and file handling, as well as more advanced topics like web development, data science, and machine learning.

## Resources

To complete this challenge, I will be using various resources, including:
